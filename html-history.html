<p>The founder of <b>HTML</b> was Tim Berners-Lee and his product was made attractive to the general public by Mosaic browser which was evolved at <em>NCSA</em>. It has become extremely popular and well-known in the 1990’s when the Internet had been developing rapidly. During this period, HTML was broadened and presented in different modifications. The Internet strongly depends on vendors and page creators who share the joint conventions for HTML. The understanding that success of Web development is based on integration of the rules has helped the Web community to create united specifications for HTML.
<p>
Most users and developers understand that HTML documents must work in the same way on different platforms and browsers. Compatibility of HTML is its key benefit and it saves time for developers who don’t have to create several versions of a document for different users. Otherwise the Internet wouldn’t be able to be so easy-to-access and the ‘battle of formats’ would be a serious obstacle for the Web evolution.
<p>
Each new edition of HTML tries to achieve more unanimity among industry players and to make sure that the documents of the developers won’t become unreadable in a brief time interval.
<p>
The vision of the HTML developers is that all devices must be able to reach the data on the Internet: computers with different platforms, browsers and characteristics, pocket devices, cell phones, devices for speech, and many others. </p>
